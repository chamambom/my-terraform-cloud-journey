# Terraform Best Practices

This repository contains a compilation of best practices for working with Terraform:

1. **Keep it Simple (KISS):** Maintain simplicity in your Terraform configurations.
   
2. **Use Remote State:** Utilize remote state storage for managing Terraform state files.
   
3. **Use Existing Shared and Community Modules:** Leverage shared and community modules to expedite development.
   
4. **Import Existing Infrastructure:** Import existing infrastructure into Terraform for easier management.
   
5. **Avoid Variables Hard-coding:** Refrain from hard-coding variables in your Terraform code.
   
6. **Always Format and Validate:** Format and validate your Terraform code to ensure consistency and correctness.
   
7. **Use a Consistent Naming Convention:** Adhere to a consistent naming convention for resources.
   
8. **Tag Your Resources:** Apply tags to your Terraform resources for better organization and management.
   
9. **Introduce Policy as Code:** Implement policies as code for enforcing compliance and governance.
   
10. **Implement a Secrets Management Strategy:** Securely manage secrets and sensitive information within Terraform.
    
11. **Test Your Terraform Code:** Test your Terraform configurations to verify functionality and prevent regressions.
    
12. **Enable Debug/Troubleshooting:** Enable debug mode and troubleshooting features for diagnosing issues.
    
13. **Leverage Helper Tools to Make Your Life Easier:** Utilize helper tools to streamline Terraform workflows.
    
14. **Auto Generate Doc with terraform-docs:** Automatically generate documentation for your Terraform code using `terraform-docs`.
    
15. **Keep Your Code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid repetition in your Terraform code by keeping it DRY.
    
16. **Check Security Issues with tfsec, terrascan, or Checkov:** Scan your Terraform code for security issues using tools like `tfsec`, `terrascan`, or `Checkov`.
    
17. **Continuously Add More Practices:** This list will be continuously updated as more best practices are explored and discovered.
