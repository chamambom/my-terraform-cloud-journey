Azure DevOps - what you need to understand

### Initial requirements before you can begin deploying

There are some prior requirements you need to complete before we can get deploying Terraform using Azure DevOps. These are:-

    Where to store the Terraform state file?
    Azure DevOps Project
    Azure Service Principal
    Sample Terraform code

Lets have a look at each of these requirements; I will include an example of each and how you can configure.

### Where to store the Terraform state file?

When deploying Terraform there is a requirement that it must store a state file; this file is used by Terraform 
to map Azure Resources to your configuration that you want to deploy, keeps track of meta data and can also assist with 
improving performance for larger Azure Resource deployments.

Store your state file in a remote - Storage Account container 

You can boostrap this process with powershell or bash scripts but we will create these manually

    > Login into your azure portal 
    > Create a Resource Group - to house your storage account and all other resources that you will deploy
    > Create a Storage Account
    > Create a container inside the storage account

### Azure Service Principal

A Service Principal (SPN) is considered a best practice for DevOps within your CI/CD pipeline. It is used as an identity to authenticate you within your Azure Subscription to allow you to deploy the relevant Terraform code.

In this blog, I will show you how to create this manually (there is PowerShell / CLI but within this example I want you to understand the initial setup of this)

User should have ['Owner' or 'User Access Administrator'] role 
To begin creation, within your newly created Azure DevOps Project 
        select Project Settings then under pipelines
        Select Service Connections
        Scope Level (subscription or management group)  

Azure Pipeline Breakdown

    Azure pipelines as code are created using .yaml syntax. the pipelines that you create will be versioned the same way as any code inside a Git Repository. 
    â€“ making change to an Azure Pipeline? You can follow a pull-request process to ensure changes are verified and approved before being merged.

Pipeline basics 

    > Every pipeline that you create, must have one job
    > A job is a step or can consist as a series of steps that run sequentially as an unit
    > Moving from jobs to stages; 
        > each pipeline may contain multiple stages
        > each stage can contain multiple jobs!
    > Pipelines can be run manually or triggered

    Pipeline triggers 
        > Pull request - 
        > Scheduled triggers -run pipeline at a specific time
        > pipeline triggers - Trigger one pipeline after another

Variable Groups 

To use a variable from a variable group, you need to add a reference to the group in your YAML file:

variables:
    - group:azure-develop

> Use variable groups to store any values that you want to control and possible make available accross multiple pipelines.
> store secrets and other values that might need to be ppassed into the pipeline.

Azure Pipelines

if defined in YAML code, your pipeline can live within your Git Repository, and in that sense it becomes an auditable and controlled piece of code along with your actual build artefacts and existing code base. A well crafted YAML file can act as your CI/CD automation effort for your code, but it can also act as your BCDR plan and goto strategy!
