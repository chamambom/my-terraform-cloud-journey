DRY principles all seek to promote code re-use and standardisation 
 
# Parameterise
# Use Variables
# Can I do this stage/task with fewer lines?
# Create dependsOn that allow me to write further logic
# Create a base template or set of principals that you will work with in every pipeline


Benefits of DRY principles

# Less code
# Easier to maintain

Create a set of pipeline templates that you can reuse and refactor to create further pipelines.All you need to do is refactor existing templates
to make the pipeline(s) more specific to the current requirements and environments that you will be working on.

Pipeline elements to consider

# stages 
# tasks
# parameters
# variable usage 
# Duplication removal
